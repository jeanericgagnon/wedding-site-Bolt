# Production Hardening Backlog

Use this file for active launch truth, active hardening items, proof matrices, and next actions.

## Launch Question

Is the current repo a clean launch baseline today?

Yes. The launch-critical hardening lane is closed, the blocker-fix runtime is live, and the release gate now enforces the Supabase-backed RSVP proof lane.

## Current Canonical Status

| Field | Current State |
| --- | --- |
| Current date/time | `2026-05-12 09:31 PM PDT` |
| Branch | `codex/v1-finish-hard-gates-3` |
| Latest Git SHA | `f2cc4811` |
| Latest commit message | `Harden launch runtime proofs and route splits` |
| Vercel deployment ID | `dpl_DQG5bU5yVbqT79Y6r4ZCx13nPtSU` |
| Supabase project ID | `atuzuobpprjstfmdnwso` |
| Supabase functions deployed | Live blocker-fix lane includes `submit-rsvp --no-verify-jwt` plus applied migration `20260511170500_serialize_submit_rsvp_capacity.sql`. Same-day confirmed/live-proven: `public-site-access --no-verify-jwt`; `photo-upload --no-verify-jwt`; `process-email-queue`; `validate-rsvp-token --no-verify-jwt`; `interactive-section-public --no-verify-jwt`; `vault-contribution-public --no-verify-jwt`; `vault-entry-submit --no-verify-jwt`; `translate-site-content`. Latest deploy wave also pushed `guest-contact-lookup --no-verify-jwt` and `guest-contact-submit --no-verify-jwt` with the stronger household verifier, guest invite-token support, and redacted public audit event live. |
| Current readiness score | `9.9 / 10` |
| Current launch verdict | `GO` |
| Production-ready | `YES` |
| Reason production-ready is not yet claimed | No active P0/P1 blockers remain. Production-ready is claimed for the current launch baseline. Remaining items are non-launch, deferred, or repo-rigor follow-up. |
| Current blockers | none |
| Current proof state | Launch-critical runtime proof is green on the exact live runtime: `npm test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`, `test:security`, `public-access-coverage`, `service-role-authorization`, `email-messaging-authorization`, `launch-closeout`, `canonical-smoke`, `public-quality`, `guests-rsvp-ops`, `guest-lookup-scope`, `collaborator-runtime`, `client-rls-matrix`, `registry-preview-ssrf`, `coordinator-dayof`, and `name-change-runtime`. The harder repo guardrails are also green: `proof:v1:client-write-inventory`, `proof:v1:ast-security`, `proof:v1:test-lanes`, `proof:v1:strict-pocket`, and `proof:v1:security-automation`. `Release Launch Gate` remains green and the repo now carries Semgrep, CodeQL, Gitleaks, and Dependabot automation. |
| Current deployment state | Frontend is live at [dayof.love](https://dayof.love) on exact runtime Git SHA `f2cc4811` via verified Vercel production deploy `dpl_DQG5bU5yVbqT79Y6r4ZCx13nPtSU`. `submit-rsvp` is live with the serialized capacity path and the database includes the RPC migration sweep through `20260512031500_seating_assignment_version_rpcs.sql` plus repair migrations through `20260512050000_harden_admin_access_check.sql`. The public-session-secret lane is live, the admin route gate is live on `admin_access_check()`, the guest-contact lane now requires a stronger household step-up verifier and accepts guest-specific invite tokens, public guest-contact audit writes are live, the route-module decomposition is live, the public vault contribution lane is live-proven, and the `.dayof.love` subdomain route is live-proven fail-closed. External custom domains remain unsupported product scope, not an open proof lane. |
| Current next actions | No active work-to-go items remain on the launch board. keep the live client-RLS matrix current and keep the no-direct-client-write inventory current only if future runtime write surfaces reopen; otherwise deferred ideas, maintainability follow-up, and future-surface rigor work live in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md). |

Blunt status:
- `P1-04 Public section DTO minimization` is still closed.
- `P1-09 Deployment / proof truth canonicalization` is still closed.
- The previously reopened guest-contact runtime blocker is still closed with live proof.
- The reopened billing, RSVP-capacity, and release-gate defects are fixed, deployed, and proven.
- No active `P0` / `P1` launch blockers remain.

## Current Launch Blockers

No active `P0` or `P1` launch blockers remain.

- `P0 Payment gate fail-open` -> `RESOLVED`
  - frontend runtime `f0cbf841` now fails closed to the billing-unavailable hold state
  - focused route proof is green and the blocker-fix frontend deploy is live on [dayof.love](https://dayof.love)
- `P1 RSVP capacity race` -> `RESOLVED`
  - migration `20260511170500_serialize_submit_rsvp_capacity.sql` is applied remotely
  - `submit-rsvp` is live on the serialized RPC path
  - `npm run proof:v1:guests-rsvp-ops` and strict RSVP smoke are green after deploy
- `P1 Release launch gate policy gap` -> `RESOLVED`
  - GitHub Actions `Release Launch Gate` now hard-fails without the Supabase RSVP secrets and passes with the focused launch-critical proof bundle
  - successful Actions evidence: runs `25705386070` and `25705683563`

## Additional Hardening Findings

No active work-to-go findings remain on the launch board.

- launch-critical findings are closed and live-proven on exact runtime SHA `f2cc4811`
- dedicated live product-depth proof now exists for:
  - `npm run proof:v1:coordinator-dayof -- --require-live`
  - `npm run proof:v1:name-change-runtime -- --require-live`
- ongoing maintainability, future-surface rigor, and deferred product ideas are archived in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md)

## Next 10 Tasks

1. No active launch-board tasks remain.
2. Keep `proof:v1:client-rls-matrix` current if future non-guest write surfaces are added.
3. Keep `proof:v1:client-write-inventory` current if future runtime write surfaces are added.
4. Keep unsupported external custom domains clearly marked as unsupported until product support exists.
5. Rerun the dedicated `.dayof.love` subdomain proof after future host-routing changes or DNS migrations.
6. Keep the deployment matrix current when runtime/deploy IDs change.
7. Keep the validation matrix current when proof lanes change.
8. Tighten TS/ESLint rigor for new code and high-risk modules.
9. Continue maintainability refactors only when a future workstream reopens the area.
10. Archive future ideas and deferred product work in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md).

## Resolved Work Summary

Resolved-history detail is archived in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md).

- Public access fail-closed and DTO minimization are closed.
- RSVP/session, guest-contact, and public subresource hardening are closed.
- Service-role / queue / storage containment lanes are green.
- Validation / CI hardening is green on the current launch baseline.
- Internal tooling routes are production-gated.

## What Changed In This Final Closeout

Historical closeout detail is archived in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md).

- Public vault contribution is live-proven.
- `.dayof.love` host routing is live-proven.
- External custom domains are explicitly future scope.
- Guest-contact hardening, security automation, and route-module cleanup are recorded in the archive.
