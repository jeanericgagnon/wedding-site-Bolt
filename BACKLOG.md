Use this file for active launch truth, active hardening items, proof matrices, and next actions.

## Launch Question

Is the current repo a clean launch baseline today?

Yes. The launch-critical hardening lane is closed, the blocker-fix runtime is live, and the release gate now enforces the Supabase-backed RSVP proof lane.

## Current Canonical Status

| Field | Current State |
| --- | --- |
| Current date/time | `2026-05-13 09:07 AM PDT` |
| Branch | `codex/v1-finish-hard-gates-3` |
| Latest verified Git SHA | `c3c2fd70` |
| Latest verified commit message | `Close coordinator and name-change MVP proof lanes` |
| Vercel deployment ID | `dpl_AbFTbLY263caiCEhQdniH2wbuM9d` |
| Supabase project ID | `atuzuobpprjstfmdnwso` |
| Supabase functions deployed | Live blocker-fix lane includes `submit-rsvp --no-verify-jwt` plus applied migration `20260511170500_serialize_submit_rsvp_capacity.sql`. Same-day confirmed/live-proven: `public-site-access --no-verify-jwt`; `photo-upload --no-verify-jwt`; `process-email-queue`; `validate-rsvp-token --no-verify-jwt`; `interactive-section-public --no-verify-jwt`; `vault-contribution-public --no-verify-jwt`; `vault-entry-submit --no-verify-jwt`; `translate-site-content`. Latest deploy wave also pushed `guest-contact-lookup --no-verify-jwt` and `guest-contact-submit --no-verify-jwt` with the stronger household verifier, guest invite-token support, and redacted public audit event live. |
| Current readiness score | `10 / 10` |
| Current launch verdict | `GO` |
| Production-ready | `YES` |
| Reason production-ready is not yet claimed | No active P0/P1 blockers remain. Production-ready is claimed for the current launch baseline. Remaining items are non-launch, deferred, or repo-rigor follow-up. |
| Current blockers | none |
| Current proof state | Launch-critical runtime proof is green on the current live runtime: `npm test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`, `test:security`, `public-access-coverage`, `service-role-authorization`, `email-messaging-authorization`, `launch-closeout`, `canonical-smoke`, `public-quality`, `guests-rsvp-ops`, `guest-lookup-scope`, `collaborator-runtime`, `client-rls-matrix`, `registry-preview-ssrf`, `coordinator-dayof`, `name-change-runtime`, and `registry`. The harder repo guardrails are also green: `proof:v1:client-write-inventory`, `proof:v1:ast-security`, `proof:v1:test-lanes`, `proof:v1:strict-pocket`, and `proof:v1:security-automation`. `Release Launch Gate` remains green and the repo now carries Semgrep, CodeQL, Gitleaks, and Dependabot automation. |
| Current deployment state | The latest deployed frontend runtime is [dayof.love](https://dayof.love) via verified Vercel production deploy `dpl_AbFTbLY263caiCEhQdniH2wbuM9d`. The coordinator migration `20260513170000_coordinator_event_checkin_write.sql` is now applied remotely, the deeper coordinator MVP lane and the deeper name-change claim-safe MVP lane are both live on the shipped runtime, and the richer barcode depth batch remains live-proven on `registry-barcode-lookup --no-verify-jwt`. `submit-rsvp` remains live with the serialized capacity path, and the public-session-secret, admin route gate, guest-contact, route-module decomposition, vault contribution, and `.dayof.love` host-routing lanes all remain live-proven. External custom domains remain unsupported product scope, not an open proof lane. |
| Current next actions | The current launch baseline is still live and production-ready, but the board is reopened for deeper product-depth scope on `Day-of / coordinator`, `Name change`, and `Universal Registry Barcode Scanner`. Treat the shipped runtime as the floor, not the finish line: broader day-of workflows, broader name-change depth, and richer barcode/provider parity are active implementation work until they are shipped, deployed, and proven against the stronger bar in [feature-mvp-gap-research-2026-05-13.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/docs/feature-mvp-gap-research-2026-05-13.md). Repo-wide TS/ESLint full-flip work remains explicitly future-only maintainability follow-up; detailed deferred/history context still lives in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md). |

Blunt status:
- `P1-04 Public section DTO minimization` is still closed.
- `P1-09 Deployment / proof truth canonicalization` is still closed.
- The previously reopened guest-contact runtime blocker is still closed with live proof.
- The reopened billing, RSVP-capacity, and release-gate defects are fixed, deployed, and proven.
- No active `P0` / `P1` launch blockers remain.

## Current Launch Blockers

No active `P0` or `P1` launch blockers remain.

- `P0 Payment gate fail-open` -> `RESOLVED`
  - frontend runtime `f0cbf841` now fails closed to the billing-unavailable hold state
  - focused route proof is green and the blocker-fix frontend deploy is live on [dayof.love](https://dayof.love)
- `P1 RSVP capacity race` -> `RESOLVED`
  - migration `20260511170500_serialize_submit_rsvp_capacity.sql` is applied remotely
  - `submit-rsvp` is live on the serialized RPC path
  - `npm run proof:v1:guests-rsvp-ops` and strict RSVP smoke are green after deploy
- `P1 Release launch gate policy gap` -> `RESOLVED`
  - GitHub Actions `Release Launch Gate` now hard-fails without the Supabase RSVP secrets and passes with the focused launch-critical proof bundle
  - successful Actions evidence: runs `25705386070` and `25705683563`

## Additional Hardening Findings

No active launch-baseline blocker remains, but the product-depth lanes below are active and not done. The shipped runtime is strong enough to launch; it is not yet the finish line for the deeper scope now required on the board.

- launch-critical findings are closed and live-proven on the current deployed production runtime
- `Day-of / coordinator`
  - `ACTIVE EXPANSION / MVP BASELINE SHIPPED`
  - current truth: the launch-baseline MVP batch is shipped on the current production runtime, but broader day-of depth is now active scope in [feature-mvp-gap-research-2026-05-13.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/docs/feature-mvp-gap-research-2026-05-13.md)
  - dedicated live product-depth proof is green on the current shipped runtime: `V1_COORDINATOR_DAYOF_LIVE=1 npm run proof:v1:coordinator-dayof -- --require-live`
  - local deeper-batch proof is green: `npm run proof:v1:coordinator-dayof`, `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`, targeted coordinator Vitest lane, `npm run build`
  - MVP bar now defined as: event-specific arrival truth, event-scoped counts, explicit exception states, lookup triage, and role-safe day-of routing
  - shipped now in this wave: event-scoped arrival writes + reads, per-event arrival counters, wrong-event / walk-in / help-desk / manager-decision / household-mismatch state handling, richer door routing, and no-match routing inside coordinator mode
  - active deeper scope now required: multi-event staffing and handoff views, substitute-attendee / plus-one swap handling, seating-change-at-door workflow, richer issue resolution history, and stronger door-to-owner escalation continuity
  - deployed now: migration `20260513170000_coordinator_event_checkin_write.sql` plus Vercel production deploy `dpl_AbFTbLY263caiCEhQdniH2wbuM9d`
  - live proof is green on the current production runtime for the shipped baseline batch
  - status: `ACTIVE EXPANSION / MVP BASELINE SHIPPED`
- `Name change`
  - `ACTIVE EXPANSION / MVP BASELINE SHIPPED`
  - current truth: the launch-baseline MVP batch is shipped on the current production runtime, but broader name-change depth is now active scope in [feature-mvp-gap-research-2026-05-13.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/docs/feature-mvp-gap-research-2026-05-13.md)
  - dedicated live runtime proof is green on the current shipped slice: `V1_NAME_CHANGE_RUNTIME_LIVE=1 npm run proof:v1:name-change-runtime -- --require-live`
  - local deeper-batch proof is green: `npm run proof:v1:name-change-runtime`, `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`, focused planner/overview Vitest lanes, `npm run lint -- --quiet`, `npm run build`
  - MVP bar now defined as: US-first guided execution, honest sequencing, reminders, status vault, templates, and post-wedding dashboard placement
  - shipped now in this wave: explicit California-guided coverage framing, claim-safe dashboard/helper copy, marriage-state plus jurisdiction intake, generic state-license/document labels, and verified post-wedding dashboard + planner resume placement
  - active deeper scope now required: broader non-California state playbooks, deeper institution/account library coverage, stronger dual-partner orchestration, and richer export/packet-ready follow-through for real-world execution
  - deployed now: Vercel production deploy `dpl_AbFTbLY263caiCEhQdniH2wbuM9d`
  - live proof is green on the current production runtime for the shipped baseline batch
  - status: `ACTIVE EXPANSION / MVP BASELINE SHIPPED`
- `Universal Registry Barcode Scanner`
  - `ACTIVE EXPANSION / MVP BASELINE SHIPPED`
  - current truth: the competitor-informed MVP bar is shipped and live-proven, but richer barcode/provider parity is now active scope instead of deferred
  - implemented now: scan/manual barcode entry UI, barcode normalization, cache-aware edge lookup, registry persistence fields, and focused tests
  - deeper shipped slice now also includes provider-path metadata, review-required match state, explicit `Use best price` / `Add without store` owner controls, Open Library fallback for ISBNs, optional `UPCITEMDB_API_KEY` ladder support, normalized retailer-option building, and miss-cache attempt increments
  - deployed now: migration `20260513064500_add_registry_barcode_scanner_support.sql`, frontend runtime, and live `registry-barcode-lookup --no-verify-jwt`
  - live proof is green on the current production runtime, including provider-path/review-required barcode lookup, owner save/read flow, and public registry endpoint readability
  - deeper barcode batch proof is green locally: `npm run proof:v1:registry`, `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`
  - deeper barcode batch deploy/live proof status: deployed and live-proven in this wave
  - provider ladder currently ships with free/open coverage first and safe manual fallback when no confident match exists
  - active deeper scope now required: fuller broad-match provider coverage, stronger duplicate/merge handling, stronger product-match depth, and richer universal-registry parity beyond barcode capture
  - status: `ACTIVE EXPANSION / MVP BASELINE SHIPPED`
  - full concept, architecture, provider ladder, cache tables, and risk notes live in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md)
- repo-wide TS/ESLint full-flip work is `FUTURE-ONLY / MAINTAINABILITY`
  - the enforced strict pocket now also covers RSVP, SiteView, siteViewHelpers, QuickStart, route modules, and `nameChangeService`
  - the latest cleanup wave restored green `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`, `proof:v1:strict-pocket`, and focused proof tests after a broader dead-code/import sweep
  - the broader full-repo `noImplicitAny` / unused-enforcement flip is no longer treated as active board work; strict-only debt is reduced again (`238 -> 205` file-scoped findings) and the remaining sweep belongs in future maintainability work
- ongoing maintainability and future-surface rigor detail remain archived in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md)

## Next 10 Tasks

1. `ACTIVE`: deepen `Universal Registry Barcode Scanner` provider coverage, duplicate/merge handling, and richer product-match parity.
2. `ACTIVE`: deepen `Day-of / coordinator` with multi-event staffing/handoff flow and explicit substitute-attendee / plus-one swap resolution.
3. `ACTIVE`: deepen `Day-of / coordinator` with seating-change-at-door workflow plus richer issue history and escalation continuity.
4. `ACTIVE`: deepen `Name change` with broader non-California state playbooks and stronger institution/account coverage.
5. `ACTIVE`: deepen `Name change` with stronger dual-partner orchestration and richer packet/export follow-through.
6. `CONDITIONAL / NO-CODE UNTIL REOPENED`: keep the live client-RLS matrix current only if future non-guest write surfaces are added.
7. `CONDITIONAL / NO-CODE UNTIL REOPENED`: keep the no-direct-client-write inventory current only if future runtime write surfaces are added.
8. `CONDITIONAL`: keep the board synced as future deploys change the truth for `Day-of / coordinator`.
9. `CONDITIONAL`: keep the board synced as future deploys change the truth for `Name change`.
10. `FUTURE-ONLY`: keep repo-wide TS/ESLint full-flip work future-only unless it is explicitly reactivated.

## Resolved Work Summary

Resolved-history detail is archived in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md).

- Public access fail-closed and DTO minimization are closed.
- RSVP/session, guest-contact, and public subresource hardening are closed.
- Service-role / queue / storage containment lanes are green.
- Validation / CI hardening is green on the current launch baseline.
- Internal tooling routes are production-gated.

## What Changed In This Final Closeout

Historical closeout detail is archived in [BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md](/Users/ericgagnon/Documents/DayOfLove/wedding-site-Bolt/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md).

- Public vault contribution is live-proven.
- `.dayof.love` host routing is live-proven.
- External custom domains are explicitly future scope.
- Guest-contact hardening, security automation, and route-module cleanup are recorded in the archive.
