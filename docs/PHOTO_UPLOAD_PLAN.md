# Photo Upload Plan (Engagement Set)

## Goal
Use the real engagement photos as primary site media and keep travel/casual shots as supporting gallery content.

## Section Mapping (Builder)

1. **Hero (primary)**
   - Lift + kiss under tree (cinematic)
   - Crop: 16:9 desktop-safe, keep both faces centered

2. **Hero alt / fallback**
   - Standing embrace with ring-visible hand
   - Crop: 16:9

3. **Story sequence**
   - Proposal on one knee (wide)
   - Reaction/laughing ring reveal
   - Ring detail close-up (blue nails + ring)
   - Post-proposal hug candid
   - Crop: 4:5 for cards, ring detail also export 1:1

4. **Gallery anchors**
   - Boat + cliff
   - Cave/boat seated
   - Beach shoreline
   - Temple close selfie
   - Grand palace wide
   - Bangkok skyline overlook
   - Crop: mix of 4:5 + 3:2; keep two scenic wides

5. **Gallery extras / rotation**
   - Elephant photo
   - Fall truck photo
   - White-wall candid kiss
   - Padres field / market / travel alternates as needed

## Upload Sequence (recommended)
1. Hero primary
2. Hero alt
3. Story set (proposal -> reaction -> ring -> hug)
4. Core gallery six
5. Optional extras

## Mobile QA checks after upload
- Hero text does not cover faces
- No harsh crops at forehead/chin on portrait shots
- Ring detail remains legible
- Gallery first row has visual variety (close-up + scenic + candid)

## Final pre-publish checklist
- [ ] Replace placeholder photos entirely
- [ ] Verify alt text/captions where supported
- [ ] Confirm desktop + mobile layouts
- [ ] Publish and validate live site
