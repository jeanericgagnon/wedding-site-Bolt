# Builder Content Defaults Guide (First-run)

## Objective
When users first open Builder, defaults should feel personal and launch-ready rather than generic.

## Recommended defaults

### Hero
- Headline: `We're getting married`
- Subheadline: `<Partner 1> & <Partner 2>` when available
- CTA: `View details`

### Story
- Section title: `Our Story`
- Intro: `From our first date to forever.`

### RSVP
- Title: `Celebrate with us`
- Body: `Please RSVP by <date>. We can't wait to celebrate together.`

### Schedule
- Title: `Wedding Weekend`
- Placeholder entries should avoid fake times unless user entered date/time.

## Personalization rules
1. If setup contains names, always prefer names over generic labels.
2. If date is unknown, avoid showing fake date values.
3. If city/region exists, use it in subtitle/context copy.
4. Keep fallbacks neutral and concise (avoid lorem ipsum style).

## QA expectations
- Defaults look coherent on both desktop and mobile.
- No placeholder text with obvious template artifacts.
- Publish-ready with only light edits.
