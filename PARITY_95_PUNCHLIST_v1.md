# Parity 95 Punchlist v1

Date: 2026-02-28
Goal: close remaining small gaps from ~90% parity to ~95%+ quality confidence.

## Completed in this pass

1) Edit discoverability nudge (Builder)
- Added contextual tip banner in Builder Canvas when no section is selected.
- Improves first-action clarity for new users.

2) Admin RSVP/export depth
- Fixed CSV header mismatch by adding `Custom Answers` column header.
- Added dedicated export action: `Export RSVP responders`.

3) Footer/mobile density polish
- Tightened footer mobile layout by moving to denser 2-column grid on small screens.
- Reduced vertical padding and improved top section span behavior for readability.

## Remaining optional stretch (if we want >95%)
- Add guided first-run coach marks (3-step overlay)
- Add explicit RSVP export presets (attending/declined/missing meal)
- Add visual snapshot diff check for template compare panel

## Acceptance checks
- Build passes
- Tests pass
- Smoke passes
